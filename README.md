# Indian-License-plate-detection-with-YOLOv3-using-Transfer-Learning
This repo helps in Image Segmentation of Indian License Plates using state-of-the-art YOLOv3 computer vision algorithm.

# Pipeline Overview

1. Getting started: Clone the https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO in your Google Drive using Colab. This repo let's you train a custom image detector. Upload the vott-csv-export data folder in your Google Drive.

2. Image Annotation

3. Training: Download pre-trained weights and tweaking the model according to our needs.

4. Inference: Detection of the license plate in the Testing Images.

# Quick start

To train your own ILPR using YOLO object detector please run these files in order on Collab:

ILPR_0_GettingStarted.ipynb
ILPR_1_ImageAnnotation.ipynb
ILPR_2_Training.ipynb
ILPR_3_Inference.ipynb

To make sure than everything run smoothly, it is recommended to keep the original folder structure of this repo!
